## Service

### Adapter

IdPs, such as Facebook or Google, provide Unity SDK to apply IdP functions faster and more easily in applications under development for Unity.<br/> However, as each IdP has different API, sufficient learning and time is required to implement each and every IdP function. <br/>
TOAST Kit Adapter provides a common interface so as to easily apply different IdP fuctions.

[Go to the Adapter service](docs/Adapter/README.en.md)

### DLST(Duplicate Library Search Tool)


When a multiple number of external libraries are used, you may encounter duplicate library issues.<br/>
DLST searches and removes duplicate libraries.
